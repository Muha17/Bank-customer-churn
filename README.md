# Bank-customer-churn
Analysis of retail banking customer data using SQL to identify churn drivers, quantify retention risk and deliver actionable insights
# Overview
This project analyzes customer churn in a retail banking environment using SQL for data preparation and analysis, and Power BI for visualization. The objective is to identify churn drivers, assess customer risk, and deliver actionable insights that support retention strategies.
# Business Objective
Customer attrition directly impacts revenue and long-term profitability in banking. This analysis helps stakeholders understand:
Who is churning
Which customer segments are most at risk
Where revenue exposure is highest
What actions can improve retention
# Dataset

Source: Maven Analytics – Bank Customer Churn

Records: One row per customer

Target Variable: Exited (Yes = Churned, No = Retained)

# Tools & Technologies

SQL (PostgreSQL)

Power BI

Notion

GitHub

# SQL Workflow
Data validation and cleaning
Feature engineering (age groups, tenure segments, balance categories)
Churn KPI calculation
Segmentation and risk analysis
Export of analysis-ready dataset for visualization
All SQL scripts are stored in the /sql directory.

# Key KPIs

# Key Insights

Inactive customers churn at significantly higher rates

Early-tenure customers represent the highest churn risk

High-balance customer churn poses material revenue exposure

Multi-product customers are more likely to be retained

Churn behavior varies by geography

# Business Recommendations

Target inactive and early-tenure customers with retention campaigns

Proactively engage high-value customers
